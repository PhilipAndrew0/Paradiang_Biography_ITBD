  <h3>CHILDHOOD STORY</h3>
  <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup>My name is Philip Andrew Paradiang.
    <sup><b>2</b></sup> I grew up in Tondo, Manila, and this is where I was born too.
    <sup><b>3</b></sup> My parents were always supportive, encouraging me to be curious and explore the world around me.
    <sup><b>4</b></sup> I always wanted to play outside, and sometimes I wanted to skip school just to play, but my parents wouldn’t let me.
    <sup><b>5</b></sup> When it was my first time going to school, I cried because I didn’t want my mom to leave me there.
    <sup><b>6</b></sup> My mom would read bedtime stories to me and my siblings.
    <sup><b>7</b></sup> Even though I was still young, I liked to spend time drawing, making little sketches of the things I saw in anime.
    <sup><b>8</b></sup> I wasn’t great at art, but it felt fun and relaxing.
    <sup><b>9</b></sup> School was a place where I could make friends and show what I had learned.
    <sup><b>10</b></sup> I’m not a smart kid, but my teachers were very kind and helped me grow.
    <sup><b>11</b></sup> I love visiting my grandparents because they’re so kind to me, and I love them.
    <sup><b>12</b></sup> I also spent a lot of time with my friends from the neighborhood.
    <sup><b>13</b></sup> We would ride our bikes around the block or play hide and seek outside.
    <sup><b>14</b></sup> Our days were filled with simple games like luksong baka, hide and seek, and tumbang preso.
    <sup><b>15</b></sup> On rainy days, I was happy when the class got suspended and I got to watch cartoons all day.
    <sup><b>16</b></sup> The town I grew up in was lively, and I still cherish the friendships I made here.
    <sup><b>17</b></sup> My childhood was a time of exploration, learning, and laying the foundation for my future.
    <sup><b>18</b></sup> My parents always found a way to give us opportunities to learn and grow.
    <sup><b>19</b></sup> Those moments made me feel happy and safe, and they helped me grow into who I am today.
    <sup><b>20</b></sup> Looking back, I realize how much those small moments shaped my love for nature, learning, and being creative.

  <h3>TEENAGE STORY</h3>
  <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup>When I reached my teenage years, this was the time I got to understand things I didn’t understand when I was still a kid.
    <sup><b>2</b></sup> What I knew back then was just to play, but when I reached high school, I learned that there was more to life besides playing.
    <sup><b>3</b></sup> I discovered new hobbies like playing online games and basketball.
    <sup><b>4</b></sup> I’m not that good at those things, but if they make you happy, you don’t have to listen to what other people say.
    <sup><b>5</b></sup> When I became a teenager, everything started to change.
    <sup><b>6</b></sup> High school was both exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time.
    <sup><b>7</b></sup> I had to adjust to new classes, teachers, and a larger group of students.
    <sup><b>8</b></sup> At first, I felt a little lost and unsure of myself, but I soon made new friends who shared similar interests, i gained self-confidence.
    <sup><b>9</b></sup> I was a problem child when I was in high school, so my parents got called often by my teachers because I was so naughty.
    <sup><b>10</b></sup> But even if I was like this, I still prioritized my grades to not let my parents down.
    <sup><b>11</b></sup> My grades were not that high, but I always did my best to not let my parents be disappointed in me.
    <sup><b>12</b></sup> My friends and I spent a lot of time hanging out after school, watching movies, or just talking about life.
    <sup><b>13</b></sup> I realized that these friendships were very important to me, and I wanted to make them last.
    <sup><b>14</b></sup> As I got older, I also started to think about my future more seriously.
    <sup><b>15</b></sup> I knew I wanted to go to college, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study yet.
    <sup><b>16</b></sup> However, I knew that I wanted to do something that would help me reach my dreams.
    <sup><b>17</b></sup> I spent time researching different careers and talking to adults who worked in fields I was interested in.
    <sup><b>18</b></sup> I wanted to be a seaman just like my father, but I changed my mind and chose this program.
    <sup><b>19</b></sup> My parents continued to encourage me, and they always reminded me to follow my passions.
    <sup><b>20</b></sup> My teenage years were full of ups and downs, but they helped me grow stronger and more sure of myself.
    <sup><b>21</b></sup> By the time I graduated, I felt ready to take on whatever came next in life, knowing that the lessons from high school would stay with me.

    <h3>COLLEGE STORY</h3>
    <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup><b>1</b></sup>College was a big step forward for me.  
      <sup><b>2</b></sup> I chose this school (University of the East) because this is where my brother graduated, and the IT program here is a Center of Excellence.  
      <sup><b>3</b></sup> At first, college felt overwhelming because everything was new, but I managed to meet new friends on our first day.  
      <sup><b>4</b></sup> I admit that college is very hard, and for me, this is survival, and you have to take this seriously.  
      <sup><b>5</b></sup> I can’t catch up to other lessons no matter how hard I try because I’m a slow learner, but I’m doing my best to reach my dreams and make my parents proud.  
      <sup><b>6</b></sup> At first, I felt pressured by the amount of work and the level of difficulty in my classes.  
      <sup><b>7</b></sup> There were times when I doubted myself, thinking I wasn’t good enough to succeed.  
      <sup><b>8</b></sup> But I kept pushing myself to study, ask questions, and get help when I needed it.  
      <sup><b>9</b></sup> I’ve learned to manage my time and submit my assignments on time, even when I feel like it’s too much.  
      <sup><b>10</b></sup> I also have reliable friends whom I can ask if there’s something I don’t understand.  
      <sup><b>11</b></sup> I’m grateful to have them as my friends, and these are some things that money can’t buy.  
      <sup><b>12</b></sup> Being a college student taught me that making mistakes is fine as long as you learn from them.  
      <sup><b>13</b></sup> This level is also a learning opportunity for me to help me grow more, reach my dreams, and also become financially stable.  
      <sup><b>14</b></sup> College has definitely been a journey of growth for me.  
      <sup><b>15</b></sup> There have been days when I felt like giving up, but I reminded myself that I’m here to learn, not to be perfect.  
      <sup><b>16</b></sup> I’ve come to realize that everyone struggles with something, and it’s okay to not have all the answers right away.  
      <sup><b>17</b></sup> Being a college student isn’t just about being smart but about being responsible and willing to keep trying.  
      <sup><b>18</b></sup> It’s also about finding balance and taking care of myself, even when school gets stressful.  
      <sup><b>19</b></sup> College has helped me grow in ways I never expected, and I’m learning to believe in myself more.  
      <sup><b>20</b></sup> I’m not perfect, but I’m doing my best, and that’s what really matters.
